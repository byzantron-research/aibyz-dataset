### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 13th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Completed full implementation of the dataset pipeline for the paper ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks***,  integrating all components from data collection to feature generation.

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Best practices for structuring multi-chain blockchain data pipelines in Python
  - Reference implementations of modular collector–curator–feature pipelines.

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Reviewed the IEEE papers, previously used in the proposal of the original paper that we are working on.
  - GitHub repositories of blockchain analytics frameworks.



- **Useful sources found:(Few Revisited)**  
  - beaconcha.in, Rated.network, Subscan API documentation for validator data collection

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Implemented Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, and Polkadot data collectors with configurable API endpoints.
  - Developed common modules for HTTP handling, schema definitions, provenance tracking, and local storage.
  - Built curator logic to normalize raw chain data into schema-consistent curated tables.
  - Added feature generators for validator trust metrics and daily performance statistics.
  - Integrated the entire workflow into a CLI-based execution system with a single configuration file.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - A modular and schema-driven approach is crucial for scaling to multiple PoS networks.
- **What’s next?**  
  - Begin test runs of the pipeline on live blockchain data.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Run pilot data collection for all three chains.
  - Generate first version of hybrid dataset and validate schema adherence.
