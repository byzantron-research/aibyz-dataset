### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 12th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Drafted the major sections of the pape the datatset ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks***, expanding from the initial proposal

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Existing literature on hybrid datasets combining real-world and synthetic blockchain data

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Reviewed the IEEE papers, previously used in the proposal of the original paper that we are working on.
  - Perplexity for research



- **Useful sources found:(Few Revisited)**  
  - beaconcha.in, Rated.network, Subscan API documentation for validator data collection

   

---

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Added a problem statement, purpose, and literature review to the beginning of the work.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - There is a clear need for repeatable, labeled PoS validator datasets, which supports the uniqueness of the mixed dataset method.

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - The paper is more scientifically sound because the methods used to create datasets and test AI are organized.
- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Finishing the overall review of the draft and start scraping data
  

---

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Begin to write code for scraping the data
