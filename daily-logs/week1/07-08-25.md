### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 7th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** To write the Introduction of the datatset ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks*** 

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Data formats and technologies that are already utilized in real PoS validator logs and agent-based simulation

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Look at some open-source datasets and research articles that have been released on blockchain AI.



- **Useful sources found:(Few Revisited)**  
  - Background reading from recent academic papers on PoS trust and validator attacks
  - Ethereum Beaconcha.in API documentation
  - GitHub examples of agent-based validator simulations

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  -  Completed all four steps of the dataset construction pipeline: Collect, Generate, Enrich, and Finalize.
  - Added images for each phase to make things clearer and more interesting

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None for today

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - For research to be useful and reproducible, a dataset pipeline must be well-organized.
- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Move on to complete the Methodology section (Research Objectives, Simulation Design, Agent Training)

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Prepare  code templates for data scraping and synthetic behavior simulation
  - Finish the dataset proposal
