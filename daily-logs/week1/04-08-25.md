### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 5th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** To write the abstract of the datatset ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks*** 

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Dataset construction strategies for PoS validator analysis
  - I explored my previously written work on the dataset of the proposal given earlier. 

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Beaconcha.in, Dune Analytics, Subscan, Cosmos SDK docs
  - GitHub repos and documentation for SHAP, LIME

- **Useful sources found:(Few Revisited)**  
  - https://beaconcha.in
  - https://dune.com
  - https://github.com/shap/shap

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  -  Identified APIs, tools, and simulation libraries required for each phase

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Real world APIs provide detailed metrics but lack structured labels, necessitating hybrid dataset design

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Using both actual and synthetic validator data makes guarantee that both realism and control are there.

- **What’s next?**  
  - I’ll write out the full proposal for the dataset in markdown with citations.
  - Also prepare a visual block diagram of the proposed system to better illustrate component interaction

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Start writing data scraper code  and simulation scripts for validator behavior
