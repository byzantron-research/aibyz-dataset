### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 6th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** To write the Introduction of the datatset ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks*** 

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Existing gaps in labeled datasets for blockchain MARL research
  - I explored the academic phrasing for PoS challenges and validator trust modeling. 

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Prior notes and reference list from the proposal draft



- **Useful sources found:(Few Revisited)**  
  - Background reading from recent academic papers on PoS trust and validator attacks

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  -  Strengthened the problem statement and motivation using academic tone

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Discovered that many real-world sources don't enable MARL-type learning settings, which shows how important simulation is

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - The proposal now clearly explains why the research is needed and makes a stronger case for the dataset in an academic setting.
- **What’s next?**  
  - Finish the Methodology and Dataset Description section with schemas and block diagrams.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Draft schematic layout of the full pipeline: Collect → Generate → Enrich → Finalize
  - Finish the rest of the sections of the proposal.
