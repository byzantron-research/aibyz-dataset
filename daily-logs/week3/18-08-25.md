### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 18th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Configured Ethereum (ETH2) data collection pipeline with beacon API integration and debugging authentication issues for ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks***
---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - How to properly configure and authenticate beacon node endpoints for Ethereum data collection.
  - Free or accessible beacon API providers (Infura, QuickNode, Alchemy).
  - Error resolution strategies for HTTP 401 unauthorized responses.

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Beacon chain API documentation (Ethereum/ETH2).
  - GitHub repositories and examples of Python-based beacon collectors.



- **Useful sources found:**  
  - Infura API reference on beacon endpoints and authentication.

   

---

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Updated config.yaml with Infura beacon URL and API key.
  - Modified collectors/eth2.py and common/http.py to handle headers correctly for authenticated requests.
  - Ran the CLI pipeline for ETH2 with blocks and validators datasets.
  - Encountered and debugged 401 Unauthorized errors caused by incorrect URL structure

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Infura beacon APIs strictly require project IDs in URL paths.

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Proper beacon node integration is essential before validating ETH2 data pipeline.
- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Acquire a valid beacon provider URL with API key.
  - Re-run pipeline end-to-end and validate that curated ETH2 tables populate correctly.
  - Extend similar fixes later for Cosmos and Polkadot collectors.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Finalize Infura beacon API setup (confirm URL + API key).
  - Test collect for Ethereum datasets again once credentials are valid.
