### Date & Topic

* **Date:** 24th August, 2025
* **Main Focus:** Collected 21 new validator data points and fixed minor code issues for ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks***

---

### 1. Search

* **What did you look for?**

  - Reliable sources of validator indexes for batch collection
  - Debug info around beaconcha.in API requests and CLI runs

* **Where did you search?**

  - Beaconcha.in API documentation
  - Error traces from CLI runs
  - Project code (validators loader, CLI parsing)

---

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**

  - Fixed import path issues and ensured CLI runs from project root
  - Adjusted validator list input to work in batches of 10
  - Ran collection successfully and exported 21 validator rows into CSV/Parquet
  - Reviewed storage writes to ensure no overwriting during repeated runs

- **Any patterns or surprises?**

  - Data fetch stable for small groups
  - Some API requests failed when hitting limits, but retries handled them

---

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**

  - Batch size of 10 validators per run is more reliable and avoids API errors
  - Codebase now stable enough for incremental expansion

- **Whatâ€™s next?**

  - Automate sequential batch runs to scale up
  - Start preparing scripts for daily validator dumps

---

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**

  - Will extend collection to cover more validator indexes in structured batches
  - Plan to integrate retry logic with configurable backoff
