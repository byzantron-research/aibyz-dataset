### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 19th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Continued work on Ethereum (ETH2) data collection pipeline, refining beacon API integration and exploring collector updates for ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks***
---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Alternative approaches to authenticate and query Ethereum beacon nodes.
  - Examples of collector implementations in open-source repos.
  - Common errors when integrating beacon APIs across Python collectors.

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Beacon chain API documentation (Ethereum/ETH2).
  - GitHub projects focused on validator/attestation data extraction.



- **Useful sources found:**  
  - Code snippets in GitHub repos highlighting how headers are passed in beacon API calls.

   

---

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Reviewed and tested all collector modules (eth2.py, cosmos.py, polkadot.py) for consistent request handling.
  - Experimented with different configurations of beacon endpoints, but did not fully resolve authentication issues yet

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Authentication failures persist with Ethereum beacon APIs when project IDs are not embedded correctly in the URL.
   
---

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - ETH2 beacon integration remains the critical blocker, and resolving authentication is essential before reliable data collection.
- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Once ETH2 stabilizes, replicate the fixes into Cosmos and Polkadot collectors.
  

---

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Finalize ETH2 beacon API configuration and retry pipeline runs.
