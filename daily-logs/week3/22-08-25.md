### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 22nd August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Built a minimal ETH2 data collection pipeline (MVP) and produced the first validators dump for ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks***
---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Beacon REST endpoints/fields for validator overview & performance
  - Patterns for simple CLI design, API key headers, and basic rate limiting

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Ethereum Beacon chain API documentation.
  - Minimal collector examples on GitHub


---

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - - Implemented modules: lightweight HTTP client + env-driven config, CLI wrapper, collectors (overview + performance merge), trust metric v0, and storage I/O 
  - Added order-preserving index loader and safe parsing for validator lists
  - Ran end-to-end: fetched validator rows, computed trust score, and got the data validators_mvp.csv
  - Verified basic field integrity and handled timeouts/missing keys gracefully.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - none

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - minimal pipeline is stable enough for small batches and quick iterations
- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - prepare a daily run

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Will start gathering data more on eth
