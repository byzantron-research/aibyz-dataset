### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**

  - Code sections with unresolved bugs or inconsistencies
  - Variables and functions with unclear or inconsistent naming
  - Unnecessary files to exclude in `.gitignore`
  - Verification of data integrity after bulk dumping

- **Where did you search?**

  - Core modules and helper scripts in the codebase
  - Repository configuration files
  - Data directories containing collected validator outputs

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**

  - Fixed minor logic and import issues across modules
  - Applied standardized naming conventions for improved readability
  - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude temporary, log, and cache files
  - Performed final validator data dump and validated output formats (CSV/Parquet)
  - Ensured data appends integrate smoothly into existing storage

- **Any patterns or surprises?**

  - Naming fixes reduced future merge conflicts significantly
  - Data dumps scaled efficiently with no corruption or missing entries
  - `.gitignore` cleanup improved repository clarity
