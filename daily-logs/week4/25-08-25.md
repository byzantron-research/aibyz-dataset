### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 25th August, 2025
- **Main Focus:** Collected validator data for indexes 1–1000 and 40000–40400 for ***Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks***

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**

  - Large index ranges for validators to expand the dataset
  - Approaches to manage rate limits on beaconcha.in during bulk collection

- **Where did you search?**

  - Beaconcha.in API endpoints and docs
  - CLI error logs from extended batch runs
  - Collection scripts for indexing and batch handling

---

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**

  - Ran collection commands for indexes 1–1000 and 40000–40400
  - Validated data integrity and exported outputs in CSV/Parquet formats
  - Monitored request patterns to confirm alignment with free-tier API limits
  - Checked storage writes to ensure smooth appending of new validator ranges

- **Any patterns or surprises?**

  - Large continuous ranges work reliably with batching
  - Some retry cycles triggered at higher loads, but data completeness preserved

---

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**

  - Extended ranges can be handled in one command but smaller batches are safer
  - Workflow now scales to thousands of validators with minimal manual fixes

- **What’s next?**

  - Push collection beyond 40400 indexes
  - Automate scripts for range-based collection to remove manual splitting

---

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**

  - Continue extending validator coverage with structured batches
  - Add better logging for retries and request pacing
