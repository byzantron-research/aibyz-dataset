## Title: *Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks*

 

### Abstract
This proposal presents a systematic plan to develop a hybrid dataset for AI-based validator selection in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain environments. The dataset will be constructed through a four-phase process: (1) collecting real-world validator metrics from leading PoS blockchains (Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, Polkadot), (2) generating synthetic logs via agent-based simulation for controlled behavior labeling, (3) enriching the dataset with engineered features and behavioral annotations, and (4) finalizing the dataset for reproducible AI experimentation. The hybrid dataset will enable supervised learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and explainability integration, contributing to more secure, transparent, and intelligent validator selection mechanisms.


## **1. Introduction and Background**

### **Problem Statement**

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus techniques have changed the way blockchain security works by providing energy-efficient and scalable options to Proof-of-Work (PoW).  PoS systems do have some weaknesses, though.  Long-range assaults, Sybil manipulation, stake grinding, and validator collusion are still major concerns to network security and decentralization.  How validators are chosen and watched over time is one of the most important parts of PoS security.  If you don't choose the right validator set, it could lead to network centralization, unjust rewards distribution, lower fault tolerance, and even governance capture.

Still, the datasets that are now out there on PoS validator procedures are incomplete and don't have the depth of meaning that advanced AI-based decision-making needs.  Websites like beaconcha.in, Rated.network, and Subscan make data available to the public that shows things like uptime, slashing history, and stake allocation in real time.  These datasets, on the other hand, are not structured, do not have behavioral labeling (for example, identifying bad or malicious validators), and do not support time-series modeling or reward-based feedback mechanisms that are necessary for machine learning applications like Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).

Also, public datasets don't have any identified behavioral patterns (such Sybil validators, lazy participants, or selfish nodes), which makes it harder to train and test AI models that focus on choosing the best validators.  The fact that there aren't any defined benchmarking datasets for AI experiments in blockchain research is still a big problem for reproducibility, comparative evaluation, and open research.

### **1.2 Motivation and Significance**

This proposal is driven by the need to bridge the gap between raw PoS validator data and its practical usability in AI-driven validator selection and governance research. A robust dataset should enable:

- Accurate modeling of validator behavior in both cooperative and adversarial settings.

- Integration of trust and fairness considerations in validator selection through engineered metrics.

- Support for learning-based frameworks such as supervised classification, imitation learning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

- Explainability and interpretability of decisions made by AI agents using tools such as SHAP and LIME.

The proposed hybrid dataset—combining real-world validator metrics with synthetically generated behavioral data—will facilitate the training, benchmarking, and validation of AI algorithms designed to enhance trust, transparency, and performance in PoS ecosystems. By introducing controlled adversarial behaviors via simulation, the dataset will allow rigorous testing of AI robustness in threat-prone validator environments. In addition, the inclusion of explainability annotations and engineered trust scores will encourage accountability in AI decision-making, which is crucial for blockchain governance applications.

### **1.3 Literature Review**

Existing works on validator behavior often rely on proprietary or siloed datasets that are not publicly reproducible. Research efforts have either focused on theoretical analysis of validator incentives or empirical metrics derived from APIs and blockchain explorers. Platforms like beaconcha.in, Rated.network, and Subscan provide rich but unstructured data, lacking temporal continuity or behavioral context necessary for AI applications.

On the other hand, simulation environments such as Tenderbake or agent-based frameworks for blockchain consensus offer insights into validator interactions under various protocol designs. However, they do not generate labeled, reusable datasets suited for training AI agents in reinforcement learning environments. Moreover, these environments rarely include ground-truth annotations such as validator class (e.g., honest, Sybil) or time-varying trust scores that are essential for supervised learning and explainability studies.

Our work proposes to integrate these two worlds: the realism of on-chain validator metrics and the control of synthetic simulation environments. By unifying these sources and enriching them with additional annotations and labels, we aim to produce a reusable, well-documented, and benchmark-ready dataset that will accelerate research in AI-guided PoS validator selection, adversarial behavior detection, and governance transparency.
