## Title: *Hybrid Dataset Construction for AI-Driven Validator Selection in Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks*

 

### Abstract
This proposal presents a systematic plan to develop a hybrid dataset for AI-based validator selection in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain environments. The dataset will be constructed through a four-phase process: (1) collecting real-world validator metrics from leading PoS blockchains (Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, Polkadot), (2) generating synthetic logs via agent-based simulation for controlled behavior labeling, (3) enriching the dataset with engineered features and behavioral annotations, and (4) finalizing the dataset for reproducible AI experimentation. The hybrid dataset will enable supervised learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and explainability integration, contributing to more secure, transparent, and intelligent validator selection mechanisms.
